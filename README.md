# Music-Theory
This is a collection of notes that I've taken from my self-study of music theory, primarily in jazz. 
I've gleaned much of the content from online resources and one-on-one lessons taken with 
professors/professionals. Some of the points that I make are through my own critical reflection of the content 
and are based on my own ideas. I cannot guarantee that everything I present here is completely error-free, so please 
do let me know if you come across any mistakes (would appreciate you to open an issue).

I mainly intend to use this as reference in my development and progression as a jazz musician, 
but I also hope this may be of use to others in a similar camp.

My assumption here is that anyone reading these notes has a solid understanding of rudimentary music theory 
(ie. notating rhythms, chords, compound/irrational time signatures, key signatures, cadences, circle of 4ths, circle of 5ths, 
Greek modes, etc.). However, if any of the presented topics may seem confusing due to a gap in background knowledge, please do 
contact me or open an issue, and I'll eventually try to add additional notes on those topics.
