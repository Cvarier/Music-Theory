# Music-Theory
This is a collection of notes that I've taken from my self-study of music theory, primarily in jazz. 
I've gleaned much of the content from online resources and one-on-one lessons taken with 
professors/professionals. Some of the points that I make are through my own reflection of the concepts, 
thus I cannot guarantee that everything I present here is completely error-free; please 
do open an issue if you come across any mistakes.

I mainly intend to use this as reference in my development and progression as a jazz musician, 
but I also hope this may be of use to others in a similar camp.

My assumption is that anyone reading these notes has a decent understanding of rudimentary music theory 
(ie. notating rhythms, chords, compound/irrational time signatures, key signatures, cadences, circle of 4ths, circle of 5ths, 
Greek modes, etc.). However, if any of the presented topics may seem confusing, please do 
contact me or open an issue and I'll eventually try to add additional notes on those topics.
