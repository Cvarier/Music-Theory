# Music-Theory
This is a collection of notes that I've taken from my self-study of music theory. 
I've gleaned much of the content from online resources and one-on-one lessons taken with 
professors/professionals. Some of the points that I make are through my own critical reflection of the content 
and are based on my own ideas.

I mainly intend to use this as reference in my development and progression as a jazz musician, 
but I also hope this may be of use to others in a similar camp.
